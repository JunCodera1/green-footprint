## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Run the setup script:
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ./setup.sh
   ```
3. Download required assets and place them in their directories:

   - 3D Models (`public/models/`)
   - Textures (`public/textures/`)
   - App Screenshots (`public/images/app/`)

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Component Usage

### Parallax Section

```tsx
import ParallaxSection from "./components/ParallaxSection";

<ParallaxSection bgImage="/path/to/image.jpg" speed={0.5}>
  <h1>Your Content</h1>
</ParallaxSection>;
```

### 3D Earth

```tsx
import Earth3D from "./components/Earth3D";

<Earth3D size={400} autoRotate={true} />;
```

### Animated Card

```tsx
import AnimatedCard from "./components/AnimatedCard";

<AnimatedCard
  title="Card Title"
  description="Card description"
  image="/path/to/image.jpg"
  badge="New"
/>;
```

### Theme Provider

```tsx
import { useTheme } from "./hooks/useTheme";

const { mode, color, setMode, setColor } = useTheme();

// Change theme
setColor("blue");
setMode("dark");
```

### Page Transitions

```tsx
import PageTransition from "./components/PageTransition";

<PageTransition>
  <YourPageContent />
</PageTransition>;
```

## Customization

### Theme Colors

Edit `src/styles/themes.css` to modify theme colors:

```css
[data-theme-color="custom"] {
  --primary-50: #...;
  --primary-100: #...;
  /* etc */
}
```

### Animations

Modify animation parameters in components:

- `ParallaxSection.tsx` for parallax effects
- `Earth3D.tsx` for 3D animations
- `AnimatedCard.tsx` for card interactions
- `PageTransition.tsx` for page transitions

## Performance Considerations

- 3D models are loaded lazily
- Page transitions use React Suspense
- Images are optimized for web
- Animations are hardware-accelerated
- Theme changes are persisted in localStorage

## Browser Support

- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Fallbacks for older browsers:
  - Reduced animations
  - Simplified 3D effects
  - Basic theme support
